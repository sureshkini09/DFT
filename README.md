# Design for Test (DFT) Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing Design for Test (DFT) techniques. Currently, the project is in its initial stages, focusing on building a solid foundation by learning essential prerequisites and experimenting with synthesis.

## Current Status

As of now, the primary focus has been on acquiring the fundamental skills necessary for DFT. This includes:

*   **UNIX Command Line Proficiency:** Learning and practicing essential UNIX commands to navigate the file system, manipulate files, and manage processes.
*   **Synthesis with Cadence Genus:** Gaining experience with the Cadence Genus synthesis tool to convert Verilog RTL designs into gate-level netlists.

## Synthesis Experiments

Two synthesis projects have been initiated to understand the synthesis process:

1.  **MCRB (Memory Controller Redundancy Block):** This project involves synthesizing an RTL description of a Memory Controller Redundancy Block to generate a gate-level netlist. The goal is to understand synthesis flow, timing constraints, and optimization techniques.
2.  **S298 Traffic Light Controller:** This project focuses on synthesizing an RTL model of an S298-based traffic light controller. This provides practical experience in synthesizing a more complex digital system.

## Next Steps (DFT Implementation)

The following steps are planned to dive into DFT concepts and implementations:

1.  **Scan Insertion:** Implement scan chain insertion techniques to enhance testability.
2.  **Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG):** Generate test patterns using ATPG tools to detect faults in the design.
3.  **Memory BIST (MBIST):** Implement Memory Built-In Self-Test (MBIST) for testing embedded memories.
4.  **Boundary Scan:** Implement Boundary Scan (IEEE 1149.1) to improve board-level testability.
5.  **Fault Simulation:** Perform fault simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the generated test patterns.
